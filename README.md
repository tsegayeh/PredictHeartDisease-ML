 Predicting heart disease: Comparison of six ML algorithms
This work is an extension of my final project I submitted to UCLA Data Science program in late 2020. The dataset heart.dat was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. I have applied six different algorithms to the heart data to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients. The algorithms used are: eXtreme Gradient Boost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, GLM, Naive Bayes, and SVM. eXtreme Gradient Boost model was found to be superior, with an accuracy of 0.9681 and AUC value of 0.9123, followed by Decision Tree model whose accuracy was 0.9236 and AUC value of 0.8833. 
Your review and comments will be highly appreciated.
