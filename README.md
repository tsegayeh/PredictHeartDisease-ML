 Predicting heart disease: Comparison of six ML algorithms
This work is an extension of my final project I submitted to UCLA Data Science program in late 2020. The dataset heart.dat was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. I have implemented the following six algorithms with the heart data to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients:<br /> 
* eXtreme Gradient Boost,<br /> 
* Decision Tree, <br />
* Random Forest, <br />
* GLM, <br />
* Naive Bayes, and <br />
* SVM <br />

The [eXtreme Gradient Boost](https://github.com/tsegayeh/ml_models_in_R/blob/main/Part_2.1_Models_XGBoost.R) model was found to be superior, with an accuracy of 0.9681 and AUC value of 0.9123, followed by Decision Tree model whose accuracy was 0.9236 and AUC value of 0.8833. <br />
Your review and comments will be highly appreciated.<br />
