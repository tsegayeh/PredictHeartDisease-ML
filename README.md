Predicting heart disease: Comparison of six ML algorithms<br />
This work is an extension of my final project that I submitted to UCLA Data Science program in Fall 2020. The dataset heart.dat was obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28Heart%29). I have implemented the following six algorithms with the heart data to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients:<br /> 
* [eXtreme Gradient Boost](https://github.com/tsegayeh/ml_models_in_R/blob/main/Part_2.1_Models_XGBoost.R),<br /> 
* Decision Tree, <br />
* Random Forest, <br />
* GLM, <br />
* Naive Bayes, and <br />
* SVM <br />

The [eXtreme Gradient Boost](https://github.com/tsegayeh/ml_models_in_R/blob/main/Part_2.1_Models_XGBoost.R) model was found to be superior in prediction, with an accuracy of 0.9681 and AUC value of 0.9123, followed by the Decision Tree model accuracy of which was 0.9236 and its AUC value was 0.8833. <br /><br />
Your review and comments will be highly appreciated.<br />
