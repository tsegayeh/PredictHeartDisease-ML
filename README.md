 Predicting heart disease: Comparison of six ML algorithms
This work is an extension of my final project I submitted to UCLA Data Science program in late 2020. The dataset heart.dat was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. I have applied six types of algorithms to the heart data to predict the presence or absence of heart disease. The algorithms used are: eXtreme Gradient Boost, Decision Tree,
